# Objective

<p align = "justify">Note-taking apps are the online equivalent of notebooks, and they can do more for you than paper can ever do, since they are digital. The main goal behind the creation of the "Notes Me" application was to build a place to add our day-to-day notes or other important information, and then save them as a text file at the same time so that they stay in our local storage. Also, you can choose the date and then save your notes according to your custom filename, so that you can access them as per your needs.</p>


# Languages Used

1. `HTML`- I have used `HTML` as the <b>base code</b> for the application, meaning all the <b>forms, buttons</b> are coded using `HTML`.

2. `CSS` - I have used `CSS` for <b>styling the pages</b>, meaning designing the pages visually like background color, alignment of the buttons, and page layouts.

3. `BootStrap` - I have used `BootStrap` for <b>responsiveness</b>, meaning using `div` tags and few libraries of `BootStrap` which helps to website to fit to all the screens.

4. `Javascript` - I have used `Javascript` to save the details of the notes as a `.txt` file. Also I have used to `generate` the current date in the input field.
